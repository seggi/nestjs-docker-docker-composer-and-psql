## WHAT TO DO BEFORE START 

### First of all you have to install Go in your machine Then you we'll have the right to start your activities. 

* To install Go you have to visit thier website for more instructions relating to your OS...,
so follow this link for installation (https://golang.org/doc/install)
* If you already have Go installed in your OS please feel free to escape this step.

## Why Go install first first?
* In the project we have a run.go file which has all commands we need to start the app.
This file will be the project run.
